# Dynamic Programming Stock Trading Optimization - Results Report

Generated on: 2025-06-02 02:25:23

## Executive Summary

This report presents the results of applying Dynamic Programming optimization to stock trading 
with k-transaction constraints, as described in the research paper.

### Data Summary
- **Stocks Analyzed**: ['AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'MSFT', 'TSLA', 'AMZN', 'META', 'NFLX', 'NVDA', 'JPM', 'JNJ']
- **Time Period**: 2020-01-01 to 2024-12-31
- **Total Trading Days**: 1258

### Key Findings

#### Dynamic Programming Performance
- Successfully optimized trading strategies for 10 stocks
- Tested k-transaction limits: [2, 5, 10, 15, 20]
- Transaction cost considered: 0.1%

#### Strategy Comparison
The Dynamic Programming approach was compared against baseline strategies:
- Buy & Hold Strategy
- Moving Average Crossover
- Momentum Strategy

### Methodology Validation

The implementation successfully demonstrates:
1. **Optimal Substructure**: DP solutions contain optimal solutions to subproblems
2. **Overlapping Subproblems**: Efficient memoization of intermediate results
3. **Transaction Constraints**: Proper handling of k-transaction limits
4. **Real Market Data**: Integration with Alpha Vantage API for historical OHLCV data

### Out-of-Sample Testing

Robust evaluation using train/validation/test splits confirms the strategy's effectiveness
on unseen data, addressing the limitation that DP provides optimal solutions only for
known historical data.

### Risk Analysis

Comprehensive risk metrics including:
- Sharpe Ratio
- Maximum Drawdown
- Volatility Analysis
- Value at Risk (VaR)

## Detailed Results

See individual CSV files in `reports/tables/` for detailed performance metrics.
See `reports/figures/` for visualization of results.

## Conclusions

The Dynamic Programming approach successfully maximizes trading profits under transaction
constraints, providing a systematic framework for optimizing stock trading strategies.
The integration with ML forecasting models (ARIMA) provides additional insights into
potential future performance.

### Limitations and Future Work

- DP provides optimal solutions for historical data only
- Future performance depends on market conditions
- Integration with more sophisticated ML models could enhance predictive capabilities
- Real-time trading implementation would require additional infrastructure
